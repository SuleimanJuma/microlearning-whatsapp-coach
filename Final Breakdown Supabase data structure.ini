📝 Summary

We have 3 main tables: users, lessons, and user_progress. Each user has a phone number and can be linked to their current lesson. Lessons are short, WhatsApp-friendly texts. Every time a user completes a lesson, we store that in user_progress. This lets us track progress, recommend new lessons, and personalize learning.
